C- Simple Shell

This is a project of Linda Matunga and Biruke Lemma for simple shell tasks.

A Unix shell is a command-line interpreter or shell that provides a command line user interface for Unix-like operating systems.
The shell is both an interactive command language and a scripting language, and is used by the operating system to control the execution of the system using shell scripts.
